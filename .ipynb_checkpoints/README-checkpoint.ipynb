My assumption was that the data was running against itself, meaning that since there was only one team's statistics in the dataframe, it wasn't comparing numbers to something else.  So, I needed to add the second team in the box score to the dataframe.  I created a new dataframe that had both teams in a specific contest as part of it, which will be called Team A and Team B.  With both teams now part of the new dataframe, I redid my cleaning and started the process over.  I created a new covariance matrix to check out my features and forged ahead.  \n",

    "Given the issues with the data, there would need to be changes made to how the data is used.  A way to combat the Offensive Rating and Defensive Rating, the two most encompassing statistics for team success, would be to aggregate them for each team month by month or in the last 10 games.  So, predict games based on the team's past month or past 10 games and have the model run that data against the results to see how accurately it can predict whether the outcome was a win or loss.  \n",

    "Future work for this project includes the aggregation of statistics into monthly ones to then predict outcomes.  Also, further work includes feeding in sports betting lines to see how accurately the model can predict against a point spread.  I would also like to use a Artificial Neural Network to help better predict the wins and losses of the updated model."
